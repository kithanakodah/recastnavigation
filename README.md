64 Bit version of RecastDemo build

Also contains a Navmesh checker

Prerequisites
Required Software:

Visual Studio 2017, 2019, or 2022 with C++ development tools

Must include Windows SDK and MSVC compiler
Can use Visual Studio Community (free version)

CMake 3.10 or higher

NAVMESH CHECKER:

you can change the settings parameters in recastnavigation-main\NavMeshChecker\navmesh_checker.cpp
and then build

From Powershell:

Navigate to recastnavigation-main\NavMeshBuilder

.\build_and_run.bat
builds the navmesh checker

.\navmesh_build\bin\NavMeshChecker.exe "C:\Full\Nav\Mesh\Path.obj"
runs the navmesh checker, should only take a few seconds
will give a brief summary, but for full analysis see navmesh_analysis_.txt in the NavMeshBuilder folder

Remove-Item -Recurse -Force navmesh_build
to delete all builds and start fresh (should do if changing file/settings, will not exist until first build)


64 BIT RECASTDEMO BUILD:

open recastnavigation-main\build\RecastDemo\Release\RecastDemo.exe
put your .obj into recastnavigation-main\build\RecastDemo\Release\Meshes
much much higher tile count allowance and poly allowance in 64bit.  However still 65535 vertices per tile (32bit and 64bit limit, use the navmesh checker can help).  
UI does not reflect max poly and tile counts properly, just force it man.
if you go over 65535 vertices in a tile it may only build part of that tile (or over poly counts etc they likely just will fail building)

## üöÄ Features

* ü§ñ **Automatic** - Recast can generate a navmesh from any level geometry you throw at it
* üèéÔ∏è **Fast** - swift turnaround times for level designers
* üßò **Flexible** - detailed customization options and modular design let you tailor functionality to your specific needs
* üö´ **Dependency-Free** - building Recast & Detour only requires a C++98-compliant compiler
* üí™ **Industry Standard** - Recast powers AI navigation features in Unity, Unreal, Godot, O3DE and countless AAA and indie games and engines

Recast Navigation is divided into multiple modules, each contained in its own folder:

- `Recast/` - Navmesh generation
- `Detour/` - Runtime loading of navmesh data, pathfinding, navmesh queries 
- `DetourTileCache/` - Navmesh streaming.  Useful for large levels and open-world games
- `DetourCrowd/` - Agent movement, collision avoidance, and crowd simulation
- `DebugUtils/` - API for drawing debug visualizations of navigation data and behavior
- `Tests/` - Unit tests
- `RecastDemo/` - Standalone, comprehensive demo app showcasing all aspects of Recast & Detour's functionality

## ‚ö° Getting Started

Check out [BuildingAndIntegrating.md](Docs/_2_BuildingAndIntegrating.md) for information on how to build the comprehensive RecastDemo project, as well as guidance on integrating Recast & Detour into your own project.

If you are new to Recast & Detour, check out [Sample_SoloMesh.cpp](/RecastDemo/Source/Sample_SoloMesh.cpp) in RecastDemo to get started with building navmeshes and [NavMeshTesterTool.cpp](/RecastDemo/Source/NavMeshTesterTool.cpp) for building paths with Detour.

## ‚öô How it Works

Recast constructs a navmesh through a multi-step mesh rasterization process. 

1. First Recast rasterizes the input triangle meshes into voxels.
2. Voxels in areas where agents would not be able to move are filtered and removed.
3. The walkable areas described by the voxel grid are then divided into sets of polygonal regions.
4. The navigation polygons are generated by re-triangulating the generated polygonal regions into a navmesh.

You can use Recast to build a single navmesh, or a tiled navmesh.
Single meshes are suitable for many simple, static cases and are easy to work with.
Tiled navmeshes are more complex to work with but better support larger, more dynamic environments.  Tiled meshes enable advance Detour features like re-baking, heirarchical path-planning, and navmesh data-streaming.
